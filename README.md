# Odin Assignment - Recursion

## Description
This repository contains solutions for the Odin assignment focused on learning recursion in JavaScript. The assignment tasks include implementing two fundamental recursive algorithms:

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: A function `fibs(n)` is implemented to generate the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

2. **Merge Sort**: A function `mergeSort(array)` is implemented to sort an array of numbers using the merge sort algorithm, a classic example of divide-and-conquer strategy.


## Usage
To run any script, use the following command in your terminal:
```bash
node febRec.js
node merge.js
